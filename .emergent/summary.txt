<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive SEO management platform. The agent has implemented several features based on a series of detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) provided by the user.

The key features requested and worked on are:
1.  **Telegram Notification Formatting:** Improve Telegram messages for SEO structure changes to show full, human-readable authority chains.
2.  **Audit Log Accuracy:** Fix Before/After snapshots in change logs to be accurate and not misleading.
3.  **Asset Domains Pagination:** Implement server-side pagination for the asset domains list to handle scalability.
4.  **User Deactivation:** Add the ability to soft-disable users instead of deleting them, preserving their history.
5.  **App Settings & Timezone:** Create a settings area to manage app branding (logo, meta title) and standardize all monitoring timestamps to a specific timezone (GMT+7 / Asia/Jakarta).
6.  **SEO Optimizations Module:** A major feature to log, track, and audit non-structural SEO activities (like backlink campaigns, content updates). This includes a dedicated UI, Telegram notifications, a complaint system, and access control rules.
7.  **Team Evaluation Module:** An extension of the SEO Optimizations module to provide objective, data-driven performance metrics for the SEO team, including a scoring system and a dedicated evaluation dashboard.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English. However, all Telegram notification messages are required to be in **Bahasa Indonesia**.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a web-based SEO management tool with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. It allows users to manage SEO networks, visualize them as graphs, and track structural changes. Key features that are fully implemented include server-side pagination for asset domains, user deactivation, configurable app branding, and timezone standardization for alerts. An initial version of the SEO Optimizations module exists, allowing users to create optimization records and file complaints.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of a major implementation based on the latest PRD: SEO OPTIMIZATIONS + TEAM EVALUATION MODULE. The agent had just updated the backend data models in  to support new requirements like , configurable activity types, observed impact, and complaint status. They also started adding the corresponding API endpoints in  for activity type management and team evaluation.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: Y (Partial  tests for new model validation and endpoint creation)
    - Which testing method agent to use? both
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or issues. The main pending work is the completion of the in-progress feature.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete SEO Optimizations + Team Evaluation Module (P0)
     - Where to resume: 
       1.  **Backend:** Finish implementing the logic for the newly added API endpoints in , especially  (CRUD) and  (data aggregation and scoring logic).
       2.  **Frontend:** Update the Add Optimization modal in  to include the new mandatory  field and other new model fields ( with dates, , etc.).
       3.  **Frontend:** Create the UI for the complaint system workflow (e.g., changing status from  to  and ).
     - What will be achieved with this? This will complete the core requirements of the latest PRD, making the SEO optimization logging more robust and introducing the initial backend infrastructure for team evaluation.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both
     - Blocked on something: No.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues during the session were resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI framework.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with React and Vite.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Architecture:** A decoupled frontend-backend application, containerized with Docker.
- **CI/CD:** Uses Docker for building and running the application.

**key DB schema**
  - **users**: 
  - **asset_domains_v3**: 
  - **settings**:  (Key-value store for various configs)
  - **seo_optimizations**: 
  - **seo_optimization_activity_types**: 
  - **seo_optimization_complaints**: 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all Pydantic models for database entities and API requests/responses. Heavily modified to add models for SEO Optimizations, Complaints, and Team Evaluation.
- : Contains all FastAPI API endpoints. Heavily modified to add endpoints for pagination, user deactivation, settings, and the entire SEO optimization module.
- : Main application entry point. Modified to add database indexes and user management endpoints.
- : Handles SEO structure change notifications. Modified for message formatting.
- : New service created to handle notifications for the SEO Optimizations module.
- : Frontend page for Asset Domains. Updated to use server-side pagination.
- : Frontend page for User Management. Updated to handle user deactivation.
- : Frontend page for App Settings. Updated to include Branding and Timezone tabs.
- : Detail page for an SEO Network. Updated to include the new Optimizations tab.
- : New component created to display and manage SEO optimizations.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The  component was getting large; the agent correctly extracted the  into its own file. This pattern should be maintained as more features are added to this page.

**key api endpoints**
- : Get asset domains with server-side pagination.
-  & : Change user status.
-  & : Update app-wide settings.
- : Create a new SEO optimization record.
- : Get optimizations for a network (with pagination).
- : Delete an optimization (Super Admin only).
- : File a complaint against an optimization.
- : **(New, logic pending)** Get team performance data.
- : **(New, logic pending)** Manage optimization activity types.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The most recent PRD (SEO OPTIMIZATIONS + TEAM EVALUATION MODULE) is very large and introduces a whole new layer of functionality. You must address it systematically. Resume by finishing the backend APIs, then build out the corresponding frontend UIs one by one (update optimization modal, then evaluation dashboard, then activity type settings).
- Pay close attention to the strict validation rules, such as the mandatory  (min 20 characters) for optimizations and the Super Admin-only deletion rule. These must be enforced on the backend.
- The user has very specific formatting requirements for Telegram messages, which are in **Bahasa Indonesia**. Ensure all new notifications adhere to the formats specified in the PRDs.
- The features for Project-Level Visibility and Telegram Account Linking are critical dependencies for the user tagging and access control requirements in the latest PRDs. They should be prioritized alongside the main Team Evaluation module.
