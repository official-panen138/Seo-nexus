<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to enhance an SEO monitoring application with several new features. The initial request was to build an Access Summary Panel to display key information like manager count, open complaints, and last optimization date on network cards and detail pages. This was followed by a series of feature requests, including:
- A UI for manually creating and managing project-level complaints.
- An enhancement to the Telegram notification system to support topic-based routing for different event types (SEO changes, optimizations, complaints, reminders).
- A cron-based scheduler to send reminders for optimizations that are in-progress for too long.
- A complete overhaul of the domain monitoring system to make it SEO-aware, including showing the full SEO structure chain, downstream impact, and a calculated impact score for each alert. This new system was to use a separate, dedicated Telegram group.
- Several smaller P1 tasks: a UI for per-network reminder overrides, a conflict detection UI in an Alert Center, and a Telegram notification for new network creation.
- Finally, a request to completely remove the old, now-redundant, legacy Monitoring Alerts feature.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack web application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. It's designed for managing SEO networks, which consist of interconnected domain nodes. Key functionalities include:
- Creating/viewing SEO networks and their graphical structure.
- Managing SEO optimizations and a multi-level complaint system (both optimization-level and project-level).
- A sophisticated, two-channel Telegram notification system: one for SEO-related events (with topic routing) and another for SEO-aware domain monitoring alerts.
- A global settings page for configuring Telegram bots and a per-network settings page for behavior overrides (e.g., reminder intervals).
- An alert center that displays network configuration conflicts.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (using  for async operations), APScheduler for cron jobs.
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TanStack Query for data fetching and caching, , TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI components.
- **Architecture**: A standard monorepo with separate  and  directories. Communication is via a RESTful API.
- **DevOps**: Development relies on  for running the backend and Vite's dev server for the frontend. Linting is done via  and .

**key DB schema**
  - **seo_networks**: 
  - **seo_optimizations**: 
  - **project_complaints**: 
  - **settings**:  where  can be , , etc., and  is a JSON object with configuration details.

**changes in tech stack**
  - No fundamental changes to the tech stack.

**All files of reference**
- : Central hub for all API logic. Modified for nearly every feature.
- : Contains all Pydantic data models. Modified for every feature requiring new data structures.
- : Core service for all Telegram notifications; heavily updated for topic routing.
- : Overhauled to implement the new SEO-aware domain monitoring.
- : New helper service created to provide SEO context for domain monitoring alerts.
- : New service created to house the APScheduler for sending optimization reminders.
- : UI for global Telegram settings. Currently being simplified as part of the legacy feature removal.
- : Detail view for networks. Heavily modified to include new Complaints and Settings tabs.
- : UI for alerts. Refactored to a tabbed view to include SEO Conflicts. Needs further cleanup.
- : The single source for frontend API call definitions. Updated for every new endpoint.
- : The Product Requirements Document, updated by the agent after completing major features.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The main API router file, , has grown very large. It would benefit from being split into multiple, smaller  instances based on functionality (e.g., networks, complaints, settings) to improve maintainability.
- The  component has a large number of state variables and handlers. Breaking it down into smaller, more focused components for each settings section (e.g., , ) would improve readability.

**key api endpoints**
- : Retrieves all SEO networks, now enriched with summary data.
- : Retrieves a single SEO network, also enriched.
- : Creates a new project-level complaint.
- : Fetches a specific settings object (e.g., ).
- : Updates a settings object.
- : Fetches a report of all network configuration conflicts.
- : Manually triggers the optimization reminder check.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority Task**: Your immediate priority is to complete the removal of the legacy Monitoring Alerts feature. This is a multi-step process involving cleanup on both the frontend and backend. Refer to the **In progress Task List** for a detailed plan.
- **Two Telegram Channels**: Be aware that there are two distinct Telegram configurations ( and ). SEO-related events go to one channel, while domain monitoring alerts go to a completely separate channel. Do not mix them.
- **Timezone**: All user-facing timestamps (UI, Telegram) MUST be presented in GMT+7 (Asia/Jakarta).
- **Code Structure**: The backend is becoming monolithic in . While refactoring isn't the primary task, be mindful of this and keep new code organized.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
 -  Sequential concise summary along with completion status. 
  1.  **User Request**: confirm continue followed by a list of next action items (Reminder Override UI, Conflict Detection UI, Network Creation Notification). (COMPLETED)
  2.  **User Decision**: Provided specific implementation directions for the three action items: Reminder UI in a new 'Settings' tab, Conflict UI plan approved, and Network Creation Notification plan approved. (COMPLETED)
  3.  **User Request**: DECISION: REMOVE LEGACY MONITORING ALERTS - A clear directive to remove the old monitoring feature entirely, as it's been superseded by the new Domain Monitoring system. (IN PROGRESS)
  4.  The user's last instruction is the one currently being worked on. There are no other pending user messages.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The application is in a transient state. The legacy Monitoring Alerts feature has been partially removed from the frontend UI (), but the backend services, API endpoints, and other related UI parts () are still present, leading to an inconsistent state.
- **Mocked**: No mocked components are currently in use.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **MongoDB**: The primary database for the application.
- **Telegram API**: Used for sending notifications. The integration is handled via direct HTTP requests in a custom backend service.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: None identified, but the incomplete removal of the legacy monitoring feature poses a risk.

**Credentials to test flow:**
Standard user role can view most data. Actions like creating complaints, editing settings, or viewing the Alert Center require an admin role. Use  for testing admin-level functionality.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has started the task of removing the legacy Monitoring Alerts feature but has not fully executed it. The following parts are still pending:
- Finishing the code removal (state, handlers, API calls) from .
- Removing the legacy Alerts tab and its associated logic from .
- Deleting the corresponding API endpoints from .
- Disabling or deleting the old scheduler and functions from .</analysis>
