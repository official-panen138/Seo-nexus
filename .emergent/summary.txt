<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary objective is to build a production-ready, scalable SEO Domain Monitoring & Asset Domain management system.

Initially, the project involved a multi-phase system improvement request, including a soft-delete/archive feature for SEO Networks. This was implemented along with UI components.

However, the user has issued a **FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT** which is a **critical, mandatory, and immediate priority**, overriding the previous implementation.

**LATEST PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (from FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT):**

1.  **REMOVE SEO Network Archiving**: SEO Networks MUST be permanently deleted (hard delete). All previously built logic and UI for soft-deleting, archiving, and restoring SEO networks must be removed.
2.  **Strict Hard-Delete Rules**: When an SEO Network is deleted, all associated data (nodes, optimizations, complaints, reports, conflicts) must be permanently deleted from the database. No residual references are allowed.
3.  **Asset Domain Independence**: Asset Domains are neutral company assets. They must NOT be deleted when an SEO Network is deleted. They only lose their association with the deleted network. Their own monitoring (expiration, availability) must continue.
4.  **Separated Monitoring Logic**:
    *   **Domain Monitoring (Always On)**: Expiration and availability checks for Asset Domains must always run, regardless of SEO usage.
    *   **SEO-Aware Monitoring (Conditional)**: SEO-specific context (structure chain, impact) should only be applied if a domain is part of an ACTIVE SEO Network.
5.  **UI/Data Consistency**: The SEO Networks column for an Asset Domain must NEVER show deleted networks. It should become empty if the associated network is deleted.
6.  **Enforce Domain Rules**: Re-confirm strict enforcement of:
    *   **Eligibility**: Block Released, Quarantined, Not Renewed domains from entering SEO networks.
    *   **Uniqueness**: A specific domain+path can only exist in ONE active SEO network.
    *   **Reporting**: Monitoring alerts must only report on the specific node (root vs. path) that was actually added, with no inference.
7.  **Expired Domain Handling**: Asset domains that are  +  should remain in the system with monitoring active but be excluded from all SEO-related activities.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI, React, MongoDB). The agent successfully implemented the backend logic for **Phase 4 (Root vs. Path Reporting)** and **Phase 6 (Expired Asset Domain Handling)**. Subsequently, the agent built the frontend UI for viewing and restoring Archived SEO Networks and Archived Asset Domains.

However, the application is now in a state of flux. The entire concept and implementation for archiving/restoring **SEO Networks** has been **rejected by the user** and must be removed and replaced with a hard-delete mechanism. The logic and UI for archiving **Asset Domains** (due to expiration) remains valid.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent had just finished building and verifying the frontend UI for viewing archived SEO Networks () and archived Asset Domains (). Immediately after, the user provided a FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT to completely remove the SEO Network archiving feature and replace it with a hard-delete system. The agent was about to start this major refactor.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Agent Testing Done: N (for the new refactoring task)
    - Which testing method agent to use? both. This is a significant change affecting the database, backend API, and frontend UI.
        1.  **Backend:** Use  or a python script to test the  endpoint, verifying that the network and all its dependent data are permanently removed from the database collections.
        2.  **Frontend:** Use the screenshot tool to confirm the Archived tab and any Restore functionality for SEO Networks have been completely removed from .
        3.  **Integration:** Use the  after implementation to run a full regression test, ensuring the hard delete doesn't have unintended side effects.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: **Implement FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT (P-CRITICAL)**
  - Issue 2: Login and deployment issues on user's self-hosted VPS (P0)
  - Issue 3: Inaccurate Pagination Count on Filter (P1)
  - Issue 4: User Verification for Team Performance Alerts (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: None, this is a new, overriding requirement.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. **Backend:** Modify the  endpoint in . Change the logic from setting an  flag to performing a cascading hard delete of the  document and all related documents in other collections (e.g., , ).
        2. **Backend:** Remove the  endpoint and any other related backend logic.
        3. **Frontend:** In , remove the Archived tab, the  component, and all associated state and logic for fetching and displaying archived networks.
        4. **Frontend:** Ensure the Delete functionality for a network now triggers the hard delete and correctly refreshes the UI without leaving any ghost data.
        5. **Backend:** Review  and  to ensure monitoring logic is fully decoupled as per the user's new rules.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a mandatory architectural change to ensure data integrity and align the application with the user's core business logic. It will create a cleaner, more deterministic system without ghost data.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: both
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: Provided multiple one-off Python scripts and  commands, which have proven unreliable for the user.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Propose creating a single, robust  CLI script inside the backend container.
        2. Implement commands like , , and .
        3. Provide the user with simple  instructions to run these commands, eliminating copy-paste errors.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a critical blocker preventing the user from reliably using the application on their own infrastructure. Solving it will eliminate a major source of user frustration.
     - Status:  BLOCKED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: backend

     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - None. The previous tasks are either completed or have been superseded by the new refactoring requirement.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P1: Phase 5 – Monitoring & Reminder Integrity:** Implement warnings and reminders if monitoring is not configured for a node added to an SEO Network.
    - **P1: Bulk Menu Access Control:** Solicit detailed requirements from the user for this feature.
    
    **Future Tasks:**
    - **P2: Email Notifications:** Deferred feature.
    - **P2: Advanced Auto-Assign Logic:** Deferred feature.
    - **P2: Refactor :** The main API file is excessively large and should be broken down into smaller, resource-specific routers.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Backend Logic Implemented (Phases 4 & 6):**
  - **Root vs. Path Reporting (Phase 4):** Refined  and  to ensure monitoring alerts are specific to the exact node (root or path).
  - **Expired Domain Handling (Phase 6):** Implemented an auto-archive process for expired/un-renewed Asset Domains via new endpoints and logic in .
- **Critical Bug Fix:** The testing agent found and fixed a  bug in .
- **Archived Items UI (partially obsolete):**
  - Implemented an Archived tab and restore functionality for **Asset Domains** in . (This is still valid).
  - Implemented an Archived tab and restore functionality for **SEO Networks** in . (**This is now obsolete and must be removed**).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The primary unresolved issue is the user's inability to reliably manage admin accounts on their self-hosted VPS, detailed in the Pending/In progress Issue list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - The Inaccurate Pagination Count on Filter issue is a known bug carried over.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Pydantic
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Shadcn UI, Axios
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Architectural Pivot:** The system is moving from a soft-delete (archive/restore) model for SEO Networks to a permanent hard-delete model. This is the most critical concept for the next agent.

**key DB schema**
  - **seo_networks**: The  field is now **obsolete** and should be ignored/removed. Deleting a document from this collection must trigger a cleanup of all related data.
  - **asset_domains**: The logic for archiving domains based on  remains valid.

**changes in tech stack**
  - No changes to the core tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : Core file for the required refactor (DELETE endpoint).
-   : Core file for removing the obsolete UI.
-   : Contains the still-valid UI for archived domains.
-   : Contains monitoring logic that needs to be verified against new rules.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **SEO Network Deletion Logic**: The entire soft-delete implementation for SEO Networks must be ripped out from the backend and frontend and replaced with a hard-delete mechanism.
- ****: The UI for archived networks needs to be removed.
- **User Admin Management**: A robust  CLI tool is desperately needed to solve the recurring user deployment issues.
- ****: This file's size and complexity are still a concern and it should be broken up.

**key api endpoints**
- ****: **NEEDS MAJOR REFACTOR** from soft-delete to hard-delete.
- ****: **OBSOLETE**. Must be removed.
- ****: Still valid.
- ****: Still valid.
- ****: Still valid.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: HARD DELETE REFACTOR.** The user's FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT is your first and most important task. The archive concept for SEO Networks is **completely gone**. You must implement a permanent, cascading delete for SEO Networks and remove all related UI.
2.  **DISTINGUISH ARCHIVE TYPES.** The archive feature for **Asset Domains** (when they expire) is still required and should not be touched. Do not confuse this with the rejected SEO Network archive feature.
3.  **USER DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER.** The second highest priority is solving the user's recurring VPS login problem. Do not provide more one-off scripts. Propose and build the  CLI tool.
4.  **CONFIRM REQUIREMENTS.** The user has provided a detailed checklist in their last message. Follow it precisely.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (Updated, but may need further updates after the refactor)
-  (Contains results from testing the Phase 4/6 implementation, including a bug fix)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
- **User:** y - Confirmed to proceed with building the UI for both Archived Domains and Archived Networks. **Status: COMPLETED (but now obsolete for networks)**
- **Agent:** Showed a screenshot of the completed Archived Domains UI. **Status: COMPLETED**
- **User:** FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT... - A long, detailed message completely reversing the requirement for SEO Network archiving and demanding a hard-delete implementation. This is the new, highest-priority task. **Status: PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The user's self-hosted deployment is functionally broken due to persistent admin access issues.
- **Flux:** The codebase contains a feature (SEO Network archiving) that is now explicitly rejected and must be removed, requiring a significant refactor.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Telegram**: Used for notifications. No changes in this session.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (It successfully found and fixed a backend bug before the UI was built).
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None
  - Known regressions: None
