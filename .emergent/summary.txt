<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary objective is to build a production-ready, scalable SEO Domain Monitoring & Asset Domain management system.

The initial work focused on a multi-phase system improvement, but this was overridden by a **FINAL SYSTEM CORRECTION PROMPT**. This prompt mandated a complete architectural shift, requiring the removal of all soft-delete/archive functionality for SEO Networks in favor of a permanent, cascading hard-delete system.

Following the successful implementation of the hard-delete system, the user issued two subsequent requests:
1.  Remove the archive feature for Asset Domains as well.
2.  Add a simple, dependency-free  endpoint for infrastructure monitoring.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI, React, MongoDB). The agent has successfully implemented all user requests from this session.
1.  **SEO Network Hard-Delete:** The system now permanently deletes SEO Networks and all their associated data (nodes, optimizations, etc.). The previous archive and restore logic and UI have been completely removed.
2.  **Asset Domain Archive Removal:** The archive/restore feature for Asset Domains has also been completely removed from the backend and frontend.
3.  **Health Check Endpoint:** A new  endpoint exists in  that returns  without requiring DB access or authentication.

The application is now in a much cleaner state, without any ghost data or complex soft-delete logic.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent added a  endpoint to  as requested by the user.
    - Status: COMPLETED
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA
    - User Testing Done: Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Login and deployment issues on user's self-hosted VPS (P0)
  - Issue 2: Inaccurate Pagination Count on Filter (P1)
  - Issue 3: User Verification for Team Performance Alerts (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: One-off Python scripts and  commands were provided previously, but these were unreliable for the user.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Propose creating a single, robust  CLI script inside the backend container.
        2. Implement commands within the script for common admin tasks like , , and .
        3. Provide the user with simple, repeatable  instructions to run these new commands.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a critical blocker preventing the user from reliably using the application on their own infrastructure. Solving it will eliminate a major source of user frustration and support requests.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: backend
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: None.
     - Next debug checklist: In , investigate the  function. The filtering logic must be applied *before* the  is calculated to ensure the pagination total reflects the filtered result set, not the entire collection.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will fix a UI bug and provide an accurate total count for filtered lists, improving user experience.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: backend
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 3: 
     - Attempted fixes: None.
     - Next debug checklist: The agent needs to ask the user to configure their Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID in the system and then trigger a test alert to confirm the feature is working as expected.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will validate that the Team Performance Alerts feature is correctly configured and functional in the user's environment.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: NA
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P1: Phase 5 – Monitoring & Reminder Integrity:** Implement warnings and reminders if monitoring is not configured for a node added to an SEO Network.
    - **P1: Bulk Menu Access Control:** Solicit detailed requirements from the user for this feature.
    
    **Future Tasks:**
    - **P2: Email Notifications:** Deferred feature.
    - **P2: Advanced Auto-Assign Logic:** Deferred feature.
    - **P2: Refactor :** The main API file is excessively large and should be broken down into smaller, resource-specific routers.

**Completed work in this session**
- **SEO Network Hard-Delete Refactor:**
  - Replaced the entire SEO Network soft-delete/archive feature with a permanent, cascading hard-delete system.
  - Modified  in .
  - Removed all archive-related UI and logic from .
- **Asset Domain Archive Removal:**
  - Removed the entire Asset Domain archive/restore feature.
  - Deleted backend endpoints: , , and  from .
  - Removed archive-related UI and logic from .
- **Health Check Endpoint:**
  - Added a new  endpoint in  for infrastructure monitoring.
- **Testing and Verification:**
  - Ran the testing agent to perform a comprehensive regression test on the hard-delete refactor, which passed 100%.
  - Manually verified all changes using  and frontend smoke tests.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The primary unresolved issue is the user's inability to reliably manage admin accounts on their self-hosted VPS, detailed in the Pending/In progress Issue list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Inaccurate Pagination Count on Filter:** This issue was present in the previous fork and has not been addressed yet.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Pydantic
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Shadcn UI, Axios
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Architectural Simplification:** The application has undergone a significant simplification by removing all soft-delete logic, moving to a pure hard-delete model for SEO Networks and removing the archive concept for Asset Domains.

**key DB schema**
  - **seo_networks**: Any fields or statuses related to archived or deleted_at are now obsolete and have been removed from all logic.
  - **asset_domains**: Any fields or statuses related to archived are now obsolete and have been removed from all logic.

**changes in tech stack**
  - No changes to the core tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main API file, now cleaned of all archive logic.
-   : Frontend for SEO Networks, UI simplified.
-   : Frontend for Asset Domains, UI simplified.
-   : Location of the new health check endpoint.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **User Admin Management:** A robust  CLI tool is critically needed to solve the recurring user deployment issues.
- ****: This file remains large and complex, making it a prime candidate for being broken up into smaller, resource-specific routers in the future.

**key api endpoints**
- ****: Performs a cascading hard-delete.
- ****: **NEW** endpoint for simple health checks.
- **REMOVED ENDPOINTS**:
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **NO MORE ARCHIVES:** The single most important change is the complete removal of the archive/restore concept for both SEO Networks and Asset Domains. Do not attempt to re-implement any soft-delete logic. The system is now simpler.
2.  **USER DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER:** The highest priority task is to solve the user's recurring VPS login problem by creating a  CLI tool. This is a major source of user frustration.
3.  **NEXT TASKS:** After addressing the deployment blocker, proceed with the other pending issues (Pagination Bug, Telegram Verification) and then the upcoming features from the roadmap.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (Updated to reflect the removal of archive features)
-  (Successful test run for the hard-delete refactor)
