**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Merging the  and  into a single, unified conflict resolution dashboard. The agent created the new page, combined the UI components, and updated the routing.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? frontend testing agent. Instruct the agent to navigate to the /alerts page and verify: 1. All UI components from both original dashboards (metrics, charts, tables) are present. 2. The page loads data without errors. 3. Critically, confirm that the Failed to load conflicts toast message **does not** appear. If it does, capture console logs.
    - User Testing Done: Y (The user reported the error via a screenshot).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Failed to load conflicts Toast Error on Unified Dashboard (P0)
  - Issue 2: Inaccurate Pagination Count on Filter (P1)
  - Issue 3: User Verification for Team Performance Alerts (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent merged the two dashboards into . When a screenshot showed a Failed to load conflicts toast message, the agent checked the API response (which was successful), suspected a hot-reload or intermittent issue, and did not investigate the frontend error handling logic that was triggering the toast.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. In , examine the  function and the associated  hooks.
        2. Specifically, look at the  block that triggers .
        3. Add  inside the catch block to identify why it's being triggered even when the network request succeeds. The issue is likely in how the component handles the initial loading state or an empty response.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a blocker reported by the user. Fixing it will complete the dashboard merge task and provide a clean, error-free user experience on a critical page.
